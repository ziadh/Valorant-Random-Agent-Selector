# Valorant Random Agent Selector:

A simple VALORANT python project that allows you to pick a random agent for a match. Not recommended for Competitive matches.
## IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE USE:
You have to have all the agents unlocked for the current version to work. I am planning on releasing a better version that would work even if you not all the agents are unlocked, ETA before the end of the year.

## Requirements:

-Python 3 or later you can [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).


## How to Install:

After downloading the file through [this link](https://github.com/ziadh/Valorant-Random-Agent/releases/latest), unzip the folder. Press on the address bar as you see below:

type cmd and a command prompt should open.
Type: 'pip install -r requirements.txt' without the quotations. 
After that is processed, type 'python main.py' and the program should boot up.
